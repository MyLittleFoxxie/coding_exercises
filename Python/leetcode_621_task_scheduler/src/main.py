# You are given an array of CPU tasks, each represented by letters A to Z, 
# and a cooling time, n. Each cycle or interval allows the completion of 
# one task. Tasks can be completed in any order, 
# but there's a constraint: identical tasks must be separated by at least 
# n intervals due to cooling time.

# â€‹Return the minimum number of intervals required to complete all tasks.

# Example 1:

# Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2

# Output: 8

# Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B.
